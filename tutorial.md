####[EcmaScript6](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.htm) introduces a native Promises spec which "promises" to make asynchronous chaining much simpler.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Promises are a new pattern to handle asynchronous JavaScript functions. They provide a way of chaining multiple asynchronous functions that allows these functions to operate sequentially and pass values. This means that each function will wait for the previous function to pass a value before operating.

Despite the simplicity of the Promise pattern I've found that the numerous explanations and tutorials on the web are typically insufficient for fully grasping the concept. One of the failings I have observed is the general attempt to learn Javascript patterns by using contrived examples.

Instead I am going illustrate a solution to an actual problem: capturing the latitude and longitude of a broswer with the [HTML5 Geolocation Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) and then turning that into a physical address.

In addition to basic demonstration of Promises, I will be advocating a way of [chaining multiple Promise Generators](#promise_land) together that can lead to more legible JavaScript code.

This tutorial is probably best suited for someone that uses JavaScript for web development, but has never taken up the language as a serious topic of study. If you are in that category then I highly recommended taking a deeper look into [JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com). It is a fascinating language that is continuing to introduce [new patterns and methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE692Clb5LU). If you are already familiar with asynchronous JavaScript code feel free to skip to the [Promises](#promises) chapter.

## Getting Started

You can checkout my [Github repo](https://github.com/Lyonsclay/Promises-Promises.git) it has all the function defintions for this tutorial. I've included a simple ruby server that will become necessary when the HTML5 geolocation feature is used.

## Synchronous Code

No doubt you have written plenty of JavaScript synchronous code, but I want to point out this most basic form of operation in case you have never considered synchronous code distinct from asynchronous code.

A typical JavaScript function definition is an example of synchronous code. Synchronous code is run sequentially from one line to the next and blocks execution of further tasks until the present routine is complete. Synchronous code can return a value to the function caller with the `return` statement.

```javascript
function output(value) {
    return value;
}

var sync = output('jumbalaya');
console.log(sync === 'jumbalaya');   // true
```
You might recall that synchronous functions can be chained together so that the output of one function is the input of the next.

```javascript
'run'.concat(' away').bold(); // "<b>run away</b>"
```

## Asynchronous Code

Now we'll look at [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout) as an example of an asynchronous function. `setTimeout` runs the code contained within it after a delay specified in milliseconds.

One challenge with asynchronous functions is that you can't capture the output directly with a return statement as you would in a synchronous function. The return statement has to operate immediately because variable assignment happens immediately, or at least synchronously, in order to capture an output value.

```javascript
var async = setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('stay classy');
    return 'to the depths';
}, 1500);

console.log(async === 'to the depths');   // false
```

In this case the return statement inside `setTimeout` is ignored and `async` is set to equal the numerical id of the timeout. As it happens, this id can then be used with the `clearTimeout` function to end an active `setTimeout` timer.

One way of capturing a value from a `setTimeout` is to define a global variable so that all functions can access it.

```javascript
var deffered = 'bric a brac';   // global variable

var passingOut = setTimeout(function () {
    deffered = 'captured value';
    console.log('check deffered now');
}, 3000);

// Result depends on when deffered is accessed.
deffered === 'captured value';
```

The [global variable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4862193/javascript-global-variables) can also be set inside a function. Here's more information on the [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) object.

```javascript
function setGlobal() {
    window.greeting = 'namaste';
}
```

Either way it is declared a global variable refers to a variable in the [global execution context](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-10.2.3) which means that all functions declared in the immediate scope and it's descendants have access to a global variable.

Creating global variables is usually discouraged, because it pollutes the global namespace. A better way of capturing a value in the global scope is to create a global object to store variables in. Another way is to avoid the global context altogether by placing code inside a function body. This insures the scope of variables on the top level is shielded from the global context and only the function name, if one is given, will reside in the global name space.

To chain asynchronous functions together they have to be nested so that they are forced to operate in sequence. Passing variables to a nested function works because all functions declared inside an outer function have access to the outer function's variables. Checkout [scope](http://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/) for more information on how variables are accessed in JavaScript functions.

```javascript
function chains() {
    var arcane = 'chains';
    setTimeout(function () {        // outer function
        arcane += ' of ';
        setTimeout(function () {    // inner function
            arcane += 'mephistopheles';
            console.log(arcane);
        }, 700);
    }, 700);
    return arcane;
}
```

The execution of each nested asynchronous function is contingent upon the completion of an event called by the outer function that encompasses it. In the above case that event is a delay of 700 milliseconds. As with any function the code encapsulated executes sequentially. By nesting a function we wait for the outer function to complete before executing the lines of code in the inner function.

Regardless of whether a function is synchronous or asynchronous nesting forces the operation of subsequent functions to occur sequentially. This means that the values getting passed are not the final computed values that the asynchronous functions will eventually give.

```javascript
var breakable = chains();

breakable // "chains"
```

If we set a variable equal to the output of the function `chains` that variable will still have the value given in the initial declaration `var arcane = 'chains'`. Each time an asynchronous function like `setTimeout` is called it gets processed in it's own time and doesn't block subsequent code. That means that the value for `arcane` has returned before the functions passed to the `setTimeout` adds the text 'of' and 'mephistopheles' respectively to `arcane`. Therefore there are two paths of execution performing simultaneously in the case of nested asynchronous code as illustrated by the function `chains`.

Passing of variables and sequential operation are two difficult aspects of asynchronous code that Promises were designed to make simpler.

##Promises

The native EcmaScript6 Promise is based off of the [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com) proposal which has a nice clear specification that is worth checking out.

Here is a simple promise to illustrate the pattern.

```javascript
var basicPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    var basicOperation = true;
    if (basicOperation) {
        resolve('play to win');
    } else {
        reject('crash and burn');
    }
});
```

If you enter `basicPromise` in the console you will see what a Promise object looks like and what value it has resolved to.

```javascript
basicPromise

// Promise {[[PromiseStatus]]: "resolved", [[PromiseValue]]: "play to win"}
```

If you get an error stating that Promise is not defined your browser may not support Promises( currently no version of IE does). Consider updating your browser or include the polyfill recommended by [Forbes Lindesay](https://www.promisejs.org).

A promise takes a function with two arguments, which by convention are "resolve" and "reject". These names can be anything, but it's better to stick with the convention for code clarity. Inside the function body will live the core operations of the Promise, in this case it is simply setting the variable `basicOperation` to `true`. After the core operations are concluded you are responsible for calling `resolve` or `reject`, otherwise the Promise will forever have the status of "pending". Both `resolve` and `reject` take an argument which can be any object that then becomes the `PromiseValue`. It's important to note that while you can name `resolve` and `reject` anything you want these are not functions you define, but are rather functions defined on the Promise prototype that you call with arguments that you provide.

A promise can be "pending", "resolved", or "rejected". Once a Promise has resolved it's state to "resolved" or "rejected" it never changes status after that. If you want to invoke the same operation multiple times and use the Promise pattern then you can return a Promise from a function.

```javascript
function evenOdds() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            resolve('beautiful');
        } else {
            reject('horrific');
        }
    });
}
```

If you enter `evenOdds();` multiple times in the console the `PromiseValue`will equal "resolve" or "reject" randomly. Now let's say we want to pass the `PromiseValue` to a function that does something with the value. For that we are provided with a `then` method that allows us to chain functions so that they perform sequentially and are able to pass values to subsquent functions.

```javascript
function get(value) {
    console.log('everything is ' + value);
}

function throwOut(value) {
    console.log('so wrong ' + value);
}

evenOdds().then(get, throwOut);
```

Try entering `evenOdds().then(get, throwOut);` multiple times and you will observe the output message alternates between "so wrong horrific" and "everything is beautiful".

You might notice that the returned Promise object is in the "pending" state. It does resolve, but at a later moment. If you wish to observe that it has "resolved" you will need to assign a variable to the expression and call that variable after the computation has occured.

```javascript
var resolution = evenOdds().then(get, throwOut);
```

According to the [Promises A+]() specification the `then` method receives two arguments that are ignored if they are not functions. The `then` method passes the `promiseValue` to the first function if it is resolved or the second method if the promise has rejected.

The term **thenable** refers to an object or function that has a `then` method. This is the most essential characteristic of a Promise and is what allows for Promises of different libraries to interact. There is some speculation that JavaScript asynchronous functions that are currently using the Callback pattern will be adapted to the Promise pattern.

What if you want to further extend the `then` chain and pass a value to another function? A simple way to do this is to add a return statement which shares a value down the chain.

```javascript
function fail(value) {
    return 'so ' + value;
}

function give(val) {
    return 'so extremely ' + val;
}

evenOdds().then(give, fail).then(get, throwOut);
```

You can enter the previous line repeatedly and the output will randomly be one of two messages.

##Promise Land

So we are now passing a series of functions through a Promise interface; this doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem right because we are in the Promise Land and all code in Promise Land is clean and beautiful.

Another way of doing this is to chain together a series of Promise generators with the `then` method. By chaining Promises we can avoid having to provide a `return` statement to pass values on to subsequent functions as we have done in the `fail` function.

Notice how the Promise generator `gotcha` now takes an argument.

```javascript
function gotcha(value) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        if (value.length > 0) {
            value = 'so extremely ' + value;
            resolve(value);
        } else {
            reject('sorry');
        }
    });
}

evenOdds().then(gotcha);
```

The attempt here is to provide [modularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) of `gotcha`. As a Promise `gotcha` can start a Promise chain because it is ***thenable***.

```javascript
gotcha('freaky').then(give);
```

In the previous cases we have only provided one argument to `then`. This means that if `evenOdds()` resolves to "rejected" then `gotcha` is ignored. In this pattern the chain halts when a Promise is "rejected" which might be the desired behaviour for a series of functions. If, however, you want to operate further on the value of a rejected Promise you will have to provide a second argument to `then`.

I believe this is a shortcoming of the Promise pattern. It would be nice to be able to chain promises together in a way where the state of one Promise is passed to the next rather than having to provide a function for either state. I guess the Promise Land is not land of "milk and honey" after all.

##Geolocation Method

HTML5 has a native function [getCurrentPosition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) to acquire geolocation data from a particular piece of hardware running a browser such as a laptop or mobile device. You can test your browser's ability use the HTML5 geolocation service with this [demo app](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation$samples/Geolocation_Live_Example?revision=635775) provided by Mozilla.

In order to use this service from your locally hosted code you have to be running a server, which is why I include the `simple_server.rb` in the [code](https://github.com/Lyonsclay/Promises-Promises.git) for this tutorial. This [Stack Overflow]((http://stackoverflow.com/a/5431823)) post offers other server options if you prefer. Running a server is also important for using the Google Maps API in the [Reverse Geocoding](#reverse_geocoding) chapter.

To retrieve location data from a device we use the asynchronous method `getCurrentPosition` which is called on the `navigator.geolocation` object and takes two callbacks `success` and `error`. [Callbacks](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/) are functions that you define and will get passed into a host function in order to be called after some operations.

The Callback pattern is perhaps the most widely used design for asynchronous code. The essential mechanism of passing a function as another functions parameter is the fundamental way to interact with events that are non blocking. In fact, the first argument of [setTimeout](#asynchronous_code) can be considered a callback function for all intensive purposes. What's different is that `getCurrentPosition` takes an optional second callback, `error`, which is triggered if `getCurrentPosition` can't get geolocation data for the device it is running on.

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error, options)
```

So now let's implement a `finder` method and define a `success` and `error` function with some standard `options` for the output data.

```javascript
function success(position) {
    console.log('Your current position is;');
    console.log(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);
}

function error() {
    alert('Sorry, no position available.');
}

// These are some standard options, but they are not required.
var options = {
    enableHighAccuracy: true,
    maximumAge        : 30000,
    timeout           : 27000
};

function finder() {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error, options);
}
```

If you enter `finder();` in your developer's console you will get an output of your current location assuming you are on a modern browser and have given it permission to check location.

Our next challenge will be to take the latitude and longitude coordinates and turn that data into a physical address. Before we do this we are going to turn the `finder` function in to a Promise in preparation of chaining the two functions together.

##Geolocation Promise

First off we'll create a Promise constructor for the geolocation service. If you recall the function to acquire geolocation data takes a `success` and `error` callback.

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error, options)
```

This makes it easy to pipe into a Promise as `success` and `error` correspond to `resolve` and `reject`. For the sake of simplicity we will ignore the `options` argument.

```javascript
function geoLocate() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject);
    });
}
```

The way `getCurrentPosition` works is to pass a current Geoposition object to the success function if everything goes well and if not it will pass an error message to the error function.

To see this work we need to set a variable equal to `geoLocate()` that we can call up after the Promise has resolved.

```javascript
var where = geoLocate();
```

If you wait a few moments and type `where` you will hopefully see that it has resolved to a Geoposition object. `geoLocate` is not so useful by itself so let's make a Promise that produces the latitude and longitude points from a Geoposition object.

```javascript
function getCoordinates(position) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        if (position) {
            var coordinates = [position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude];
            resolve(coordinates);
        } else {
            reject(position);
        }
    });
}
```

Now let's create a fresh logging function `grab` to display the result and for good measure we'll recycle `throwOut` so we have an error function to pass.

```javascript
function grab(val) {
    console.log(val);
}

function throwOut(value) {
    console.log('so wrong ' + value);
}

geoLocate().then(getCoordinates).then(grab, throwOut);
```

##Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the process of getting a physical address from latitude and longitude coordinates. For this example we are going to use the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to perform the [Reverse Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-reverse).

To start with you have to include the script that contains the Google Maps Javascript code for connection to the API. This is already included in the file 'index.html' provided with the [code](https://github.com/Lyonsclay/Promises-Promises.git) for this tutorial.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
```

The Google Maps API performs many services which we are only using a small portion of. I say this because the code uses large messy objects, but it is free and well maintained by Google.

Here is a simple function that takes an array containing latitude and longitude and retrieves the corresponding physical address which it then logs to the console.

```javascript
function reverseGeocode(points) {
    var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder(),
        coordinates = new google.maps.LatLng(points[0], points[1]),
        setting = { 'latLng': coordinates };
    geocoder.geocode(setting, function (results, status) {
        if (status === 'OK') {
            var address = (results[0].formatted_address);
            console.log(address);
        } else {
            alert(status);
        }
    });
}
```

For the sake of producing a physcial address we need not go any further.

```javascript
geoLocate().then(getCoordinates).then(reverseGeocode);
```

But,     for the sake of demonstration let's turn `reverseGeocode` into a Promise. To do this we will pass `results` to the `resolve` function and `status` to the `reject` function.

```javascript
function getAddress(points) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder(),
            coordinates = new google.maps.LatLng(points[0], points[1]),
            setting = { 'latLng': coordinates };
        geocoder.geocode(setting, function (results, status) {
            if (status === 'OK') {
                resolve(results[0].formatted_address);
            } else {
                reject(status);
            }
        });
    });
}
```

Now we can partake in the fruit of our labor and find out where exactly in the physcial world we are.

```javascript
geoLocate().then(getCoordinates).then(getAddress).then(grab, throwOut);
```

If all worked out you will get something close to the current address your are occupying.

Yeaahh!
